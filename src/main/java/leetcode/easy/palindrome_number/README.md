# Palindrome Number 🧩

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Дано число х, вернуть true, если оно является палиндромом и false в противном случае.
```java
Example 1:
    Input: x = 121
    Output: true
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

```java
Example 2:
    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

```java
Example 3:
    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
